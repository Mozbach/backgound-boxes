# backgound-boxes
Another 50 projects, 50 days project. Basically it is 1 background scattered over many boxes. I'm not excited about this, seems VERY css heavy. But who knows, maybe I learn a lot.

Guy basically used a nested loop to offset the backgroundPosition of each div. Not too complicated.
I find with these type of things, it isn't about understanding what is being done, but more about trying to think of something like this yourself.
